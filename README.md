# Capturing Digital Signature in android.
To capture the Digital Signature using android canvas, first create an XML file which contains the canvas on 
which we can register our signatures using our fingers. Then convert that signature into an Image, create a 
directory in mobile storage and save the signature image in that directory on click of the save button then show the image in
another activity using the path of the directory.
